# Introduction to Image Classification with Python

In this (Houston Data Science)[1] meetup, we will teach you how to do simple image classification tasks.

# Install Python 3 on your own BEFORE coming to class
Follow the tutorial in the [Intro to Python][2] repository in order to install the Anaconda distribution with Python 3.

Also, install the following libraries. If you use the Anaconda distribution, these libraries should be easily installable with `conda`.

1. torch
2. matplotlib
3. torchvision

It will be better if you have access to a GPU on your laptop. Otherwise, I will show you an easy way if you don't have access to a GPU.
