# Introduction to Image Classification with Python

In this [Houston Data Science][1] meetup, we will teach you how to do simple image classification tasks. The focus of this session will be to learn how to use neural networks to do a simple image classification problem.

## Prerequisities
1. Nothing more than high school or first year undergraduate math - matrices, how to differentiate etc.
2. Working knowledge of Python
3. Laptop preferably with an NVidia GPU. If not, don't worry about it.

# Option 1: Install Python 3 on your own BEFORE coming to class
Follow the tutorial in the [Intro to Python][2] repository in order to install the Anaconda distribution with Python 3.

Also, install the following libraries. If you use the Anaconda distribution, these libraries should be easily installable with `conda`.

1. torch>=0.4.0
2. matplotlib
3. torchvision
4. pandas
5. scikit-learn

It will be better if you have a NVidia GPU on your laptop.

# Option 2: Use Google's colab + github
Google recently announced their version of Jupyter notebooks called as [colab][3] where they offer free GPUs for use. It is sufficient to have a Google account to use their colab notebooks.
